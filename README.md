# Intro_to_Data_Science_Course_Notes

These notes accompany an Intro to Data Science Course I taught at Oregon Institute of Technology in the Fall 2023 term.  The course assumes no prior programming knowledge.

The focus of the course was to introduce the four fundamental Python Data Science libraries: Standard Library, NumPy, Pandas, and Sci-Kit Learn.  Through learning these libraries, students are introduced to many Data Science concepts culminating in the study of linear models and gradient descent.
